# SpotifyReviews

The project undertakes an in-depth exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on a dataset of Spotify reviews, initiating from data cleaning and null-checking, to advanced steps such as data visualization and tokenization. 

It also applies a variety of machine learning techniques and models, highlighting the practical application of NLP in the field of data science. This project not only provides insightful visualizations but also predictive models, enabling us to understand and predict user sentiments and behavior based on their reviews. 

The ultimate goal is to extract meaningful information from the reviews which can be used to enhance user experience and guide decision-making processes.
